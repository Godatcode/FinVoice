# 🎤 Voice Recognition Setup Guide

## Overview
FinVoice now uses a cloud-based speech recognition system that works on any device (including emulators). The system records audio locally and processes it through Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

## Current Status
✅ **Working Now**: Mock transcription system for testing
🔄 **Ready for Production**: Google Cloud STT integration (needs API key)

## Quick Test (Mock Mode)
1. Tap the microphone icon in the overview screen
2. Wait for "Listening... Speak now" message
3. The system will simulate recording and return a random expense phrase
4. You'll see the transcription and can process it as a real expense

## Setup for Real Google Cloud STT

### Step 1: Get Google Cloud API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Speech-to-Text API**
4. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
5. Click **Create Credentials > API Key**
6. Copy the API key

### Step 2: Configure the App
1. Open `src/config/api.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Test Real Voice Recognition
1. Rebuild the app: `npx react-native run-android`
2. Tap the microphone icon
3. Speak clearly: "Add dinner 7300 rupees"
4. The system will record your voice and send it to Google Cloud STT
5. You'll get real transcription results

## Features

### Voice Input Examples
- **"Add dinner 7300 rupees"** → Food & Dining, ₹7300
- **"Uber ride 450"** → Transportation, ₹450
- **"Movie tickets 1200"** → Entertainment, ₹1200
- **"Electricity bill 2500"** → Utilities, ₹2500
- **"Shopping clothes 3500"** → Shopping, ₹3500

### What Happens
1. 🎙️ **Tap mic** → Permission check → Start recording
2. 🎵 **Visual feedback** → Pulse animations + volume waves
3. 🗣️ **TTS feedback** → "Listening... Speak now"
4. ⏱️ **Recording** → 2-3 seconds of audio capture
5. ☁️ **Processing** → Audio sent to Google Cloud STT (or mock)
6. 📝 **Transcription** → Speech converted to text
7. 💰 **Expense parsing** → Amount, category, description extracted
8. ✅ **Expense added** → Real-time dashboard update
9. 🗣️ **TTS confirmation** → "Expense added successfully..."
10. 📊 **Chart updates** → Dashboard reflects new data

## Troubleshooting

### Mock Mode Issues
- If you see "Using mock transcription", the API key isn't configured
- Mock mode works offline and is perfect for testing

### Real API Issues
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is correct
- Ensure Speech-to-Text API is enabled in Google Cloud
- Check API quotas and billing

### Permission Issues
- Grant microphone permission when prompted
- If denied, go to Settings > Apps > FinVoice > Permissions > Microphone
